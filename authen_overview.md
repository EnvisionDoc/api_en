# API Authentication

With regard to EnOS API authentication, the SA (service account) is taken as the identity of an application or a developer. In the REST API request, the SA is sent to the EnOS service, which then authenticates the user and performs the required authorized access. 

## Getting the Service Account

The service account SA consists of the application's `AccessKey` and `SecretKey`, which is generated by registering an application on the EnOS Console. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Log into the EnOS Console and select **Application Registration** in the left navigation bar.
2. Click the **Create App** button, enter the details of the new application, and click **Confirm**.
3. After the application registration is completed, click the application name in the **Apps of This OU** tab to open the **App Detail** page and view the application's `AccessKey` and `SecretKey`.

## Authorizing Service Accounts

Only after a service account is authorized can applications be allowed to access the authorized resources on EnOS. For detailed steps on how to authorize a service account, see [Managing Service Accounts](/docs/enos/en/2.0.9/iam/howto/service_account/managing_service_account.html).

## API Operation Permissions

Before authorizing a service account, you need to create a corresponding permission policy. The resources that need to be accessed by each API and the corresponding operation permissions are given as follows:
